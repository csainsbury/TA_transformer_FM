**2. Step-by-Step Development Guide**

**Step 1: Data Preparation**

*Objective:* Prepare your data in a format suitable for transformer input.

- **1.1 Data Collection**
  - Collect the triplet data: `['data_type', 'value', 'timestamp']` for each patient.
  - Ensure that the data is anonymized and complies with all relevant regulations.

- **1.2 Handling Missing Data**
  - Since you're avoiding imputation, represent missing data explicitly.
  - Introduce a special token or value to indicate missingness.

- **1.3 Encoding Data Types**
  - **Categorical Variables:**
    - Use embeddings for categorical `data_type`.
    - Assign a unique index to each `data_type` and initialize a learnable embedding matrix.
  - **Continuous Variables:**
    - Normalize or standardize the `value` field.
    - You may embed continuous values directly or use techniques like discretization followed by embedding.

- **1.4 Time Encoding**
  - Compute the time differences between events to capture temporal gaps.
  - Use relative time embeddings:
    - Create a function that maps time differences to embeddings.
    - Alternatively, use continuous time embeddings like Time2Vec.

- **1.5 Sequence Construction**
  - For each patient, sort events chronologically.
  - Construct sequences of triplets ready for model input.

**Step 2: Model Architecture**

*Objective:* Build a transformer model tailored for irregular time-series data.

- **2.1 Input Layer**
  - **Embedding Layer:**
    - Embed `data_type` and `value`.
    - Combine embeddings with time embeddings.
    - Concatenate or sum the embeddings to get a unified representation.

- **2.2 Positional Encoding**
  - Modify standard positional encoding to handle irregular time intervals.
  - Options include:
    - **Relative Positional Encoding:**
      - Use the time difference between events.
    - **Continuous Positional Encoding:**
      - Apply functions like sine and cosine to the time stamps.

- **2.3 Transformer Encoder Layers**
  - Stack multiple transformer encoder layers.
  - Adjust attention mechanisms to account for time information.
    - **Time-Aware Attention:**
      - Incorporate time embeddings into the attention calculations.
      - Modify the attention score to decay with increasing time gaps (e.g., using a time-decay function).

- **2.4 Output Layer**
  - **Sequence Output:**
    - Obtain embeddings for each time step.
  - **Pooling Layer:**
    - Apply pooling (e.g., mean, max) to get a fixed-size patient-level embedding.
  - **Embedding Vector:**
    - Use this vector for downstream tasks.

**Step 3: Self-Supervised Learning Objective**

*Objective:* Train the model to learn meaningful representations without labeled data.

- **3.1 Masked Reconstruction (Masked Modeling)**
  - Randomly mask portions of the input data (e.g., `value` or `data_type`).
  - The model tries to reconstruct the masked parts.
  - **Implementation:**
    - Create a masking function that selects random positions to mask.
    - Use a special token or value to indicate masked elements.

- **3.2 Contrastive Learning**
  - Generate positive and negative pairs by data augmentation.
  - The model learns to distinguish between similar and dissimilar sequences.
  - **Implementation:**
    - Apply transformations like jittering, scaling, or time warping to create augmented sequences.
    - Use a contrastive loss function (e.g., InfoNCE).

- **3.3 Loss Functions**
  - **Masked Reconstruction Loss:**
    - Use cross-entropy for categorical variables.
    - Use mean squared error for continuous variables.
  - **Contrastive Loss:**
    - Implement the contrastive loss appropriate for your contrastive learning setup.

**Step 4: Training Procedure**

*Objective:* Train the model efficiently, starting on limited hardware.

- **4.1 Training on 3090Ti**
  - **Batch Size:**
    - Start with a small batch size that fits in memory.
  - **Gradient Accumulation:**
    - Accumulate gradients over multiple batches to simulate a larger batch size.
  - **Mixed Precision Training:**
    - Use FP16 precision to reduce memory usage.

- **4.2 Scaling Up on A100-80G**
  - Increase batch size and model complexity as allowed by increased memory.
  - Consider using multi-GPU training if available.

- **4.3 Optimization Techniques**
  - Use learning rate schedulers (e.g., warm-up followed by decay).
  - Monitor training with validation metrics.

**Step 5: Model Evaluation and Fine-Tuning**

*Objective:* Prepare the model for downstream predictive tasks.

- **5.1 Embedding Extraction**
  - Extract embeddings from the trained model for each patient.
  - Save embeddings for use in downstream tasks.

- **5.2 Adding Task-Specific Heads**
  - **Classification Head:**
    - For binary or multi-class classification tasks.
    - Use a simple feed-forward network on top of embeddings.
  - **Regression Head:**
    - For predicting continuous outcomes.
    - Similarly, use a feed-forward network.

- **5.3 Fine-Tuning**
  - Optionally fine-tune the entire model or just the task-specific head on labeled data.
  - Use appropriate loss functions for the tasks.

**Step 6: Incorporating Additional Features**

*Objective:* Ensure that new data types can be added without significant rework.

- **6.1 Modular Design**
  - Structure your code to allow easy addition of new `data_type` entries.
  - Use configuration files or dictionaries to manage `data_type` mappings.

- **6.2 Embedding Layers**
  - When adding new features, expand the embedding layers accordingly.
  - Initialize new embeddings properly (e.g., random initialization or based on similar existing embeddings).

- **6.3 Re-Training or Fine-Tuning**
  - Decide whether to retrain the model from scratch or fine-tune it with the new features.
  - Consider the impact on the existing learned representations.

**Step 7: Stretch Goal - Generating Synthetic Data**

*Objective:* Extend the model to generate realistic synthetic data.

- **7.1 Generative Modeling**
  - Use models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) or Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
  - Adapt these models for sequential, time-series data.

- **7.2 Model Integration**
  - Incorporate the generative model into your existing architecture.
  - Use the encoder for embeddings and add a decoder for data generation.

- **7.3 Training the Generative Model**
  - Train the model to reconstruct input sequences or generate new sequences from latent variables.
  - Evaluate the quality of synthetic data using statistical measures and domain expert assessment.

  - Investigate models specifically designed for irregular time-series data, such as the **Temporal Fusion Transformer** or **Transformers with Continuous-Time Models**.

- **Evaluation Metrics**

  - Define appropriate metrics for self-supervised learning to monitor training progress.
  - For downstream tasks, use domain-specific metrics (e.g., ROC-AUC for classification).

- **Documentation and Code Structure**

  - Keep your code well-documented to facilitate future modifications.
  - Use version control systems like **Git** for tracking changes.

- **Collaboration and Reproducibility**

  - Consider sharing parts of your code and findings with the research community.
  - Ensure that your experiments are reproducible by setting random seeds and documenting the environment setup.

**4. Future Integration of Image Data**

- **Modular Embedding Layer for Images**

  - Develop a separate image encoder (e.g., using CNNs or Vision Transformers).
  - Extract image embeddings that can be combined with EHR embeddings.

- **Fusion Techniques**

  - Explore methods to fuse embeddings from different modalities.
  - Options include concatenation, attention-based fusion, or gating mechanisms.

- **Unified Model Training**

  - Train the multimodal model end-to-end if computational resources allow.
  - Alternatively, train modality-specific encoders separately and combine them during fine-tuning.
